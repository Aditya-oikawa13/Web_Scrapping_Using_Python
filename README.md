## Scrapping syllabus from NIT Rourkela website

This is the code I written in order to scrap 5th semester syllabus from my college website. It was very tedious process to go to individual subjects and get the syllabus so I used web scrapping to do it.

I used BeautifulSoup library of python to extract the syllabus. For that I used methods like "get","find", "find_all" etc.
